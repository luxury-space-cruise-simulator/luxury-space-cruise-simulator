# YBS Galactic Tours React Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Description

YBS Galactic Tours is a (fake) space tour company that with an online preview of their upcoming line of space
tours. To let people know what they can expect, the user
can select an option from a number of space tours and be shown a few images of the locations
theyâ€™ll be stopping at. We are of course assuming faster than light-speed travel. The company wants to assure their clients that their safety is paramount, so no dates with near-earth objects are displayed.

## About this Project

Created using NASA APIs for near-earth object dates and images of Mars. 

Project includes React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
